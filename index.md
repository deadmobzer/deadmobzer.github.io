### Welcome to my site

My name is deadmobzer. Currently a second year student of Advanced Computing (Honours) at the Australian National University. Over here you'll find my [blog](deadmobzer.github.io/blog) and my [projects](deadmobzer.github.io/projects). If you want to learn more about me, there's a [section for that too](deadmobzer.github.io/about)!
